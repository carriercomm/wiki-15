''Nimble Machines is dedicated to rediscovering the spark that animates computing, reviving the revolution, and letting Babylon babble on.''

----

I was inspired, when reading some Lisp papers by Henry G. Baker, by the name of his company: Nimble Computer Corporation.

It struck me that nimbleness is missing from computing. Computers seem fragile and clumsy. They inexplicably break, and fall over.

Nimble Machines captures, for me, the idea, the dream, the ideal, of computers that are simple, smart, flexible, reliable, fast ... and nimble.

And maybe, if we start using better programming tools, we can get there.
