Two weeks ago I decided I just ''had'' to have a scooter. I saw myself zipping around Portland, running errands, doing shopping, and looking very cool all the while.

After doing some research I decided that the scooter for me was the [[http://bajajusa.com/ Bajaj]] [[http://bajajusa.com/scooters.htm Chetak]]. Here is a picture: [[http://www.sfscootercentre.com/img/showroom/newScoots/chetak04/5.gif Bajaj Chetak]]

It is very old-skool. All-metal frame (new scoots are mostly plastic), 4 speed manual transmission (again, almost all new scoots are automatic), spare tire, lots of storage space. In the 70s Bajaj made Vespas under license from Piaggio, so it's no surprise that their scooters are very Vespa-like.

I was all set to buy a Chetak until I read a review. It had old-world charm (dim headlamp), loads of character (quirky handlebar controls), and lousy brakes. Hmmm. And they're relatively expensive: in the US MSRP is supposed to be $2699, but everyone seems to want to sell them for 3k and above.

I started to look elsewhere; that's when I rekindled an old love affair: the DualPurposeMotorcycle.
