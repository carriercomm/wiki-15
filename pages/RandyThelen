Hi, I'm the designer and builder of [[http://madscientistroom.org/mippy/ mippy]]. ''And one of the co-builders, if not co-designers, of Mason!''

Other than that, I'm a non-descript engineer working for [[http://netapp.com Network Appliance]].

I'm now building a Forth CPU inside an [[wiki?SX52 SX52]] PIC processor,  which is the heart of the [[http://www.xgamestation.com eXtreme Game Station]].  The PIC has five 8 bit bi-directional general purpose I/O pins on it.  My project is to turn the CPU into one which inteprets stack-based opcodes from the external RAM (SRAM, in this case).  The two stacks for the CPU will be maintained within the CPU in 144 of the 256 bytes of CPU RAM.  SX52 instructions can only be executed out of program ROM within the chip.  So, whatever instructions I build into the Forth CPU are the only primitives that will be available to the Forth programmer.  This is different from normal Forth environments where programmers are free to expand the Forth environment by building their own primitives with assembly.  Unfortunately that's just not possible with the SX52.  I'll add notes here from time to time.

''Why not create a page like Sx52ForthCpu or Sx52Forth or Sx52ForthProcessor and put everything there?''

''I feel your pain in trying to link to pages like "SX52". This "will" be fixed. I promise. WikiWords are going to go away, and a much nicer simpler flexibler syntax will replace them, and you'll be able to happily link to [[wiki?SX52 SX52]].'' --DavidFrech
