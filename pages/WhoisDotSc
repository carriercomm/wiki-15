HttpResponseCodes

----

I've noticed some interesting entries in my web server logs. They look something like this:

66.228.202.122 - - [24/Jan/2005:02:27:27 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 206 2168 "http:
//www.whois.sc/nimblemachines.com" "SurveyBot/2.3 (Whois Source)"

I need to look up HTTP response code 206.

What is interesting is what is on their site: WhoIs:nimblemachines.com.

''I just updated my contact info. WhoIs:anarchitech.org.''

''Uh-oh.''

[[http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html RFC2616]]

10.2.7 206 Partial Content

The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource. The request MUST have included a Range header field (section 14.35) indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range header field (section 14.27) to make the request conditional.

The response MUST include the following header fields:

      - Either a Content-Range header field (section 14.16) indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges
        Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a
        Content-Length header field is present in the response, its
        value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the
        message-body.

      - Date

      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request

      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant

If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly, see 13.5.4.

A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.

My guess is that the bot is using If-changed-since to see if the page has changed since its last visit. If not, it would be pointless to index it. (This is, I think, why Google has practically stopped visiting nimblemachines.com.)

Ok, no, I lied. Another idea. Since they are spidering only to find out what web server software the site runs, and what its meta tags are, perhaps they have a "clever" way of only requesting part of the top-level index page.
