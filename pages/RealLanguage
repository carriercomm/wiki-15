C'mon, man. You forgot the most important one: '''assembler'''.

''God help me, I think assembler is actually cool.  In small doses.  For real time stuff.  Maybe.''

More than cool, it's a necessary ingredient in the universe, unlike those other so-called languages. Personally, I ''love'' assembler. There is an austere beauty to it, and it's the only way to feel close to the machine ... if you know what I mean by "close". ;-)
