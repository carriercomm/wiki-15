[[http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6282 The command line: the best newbie interface?]]

This is a ''very'' interesting article. While teaching computer use in an adult education course the author discovered that, spun properly, the command line interface can be:

* a source of a sense of control

* a "discoverable" interface

* a source of a sense of mastery

and a host of other things largely missing from more "friendly" interfaces - like GUIs. --DavidFrech

Hmm, echoes of [[http://anarchitech.org/wiki/showPage.yaws?node=DesigningUserInterfaces Designing User Interfaces]]. Couldn't agree more.  I also realized that I
erred in a reply to Randy about EaseOfMacInterface.  Flower has tripped on more than one occasion, usually on printing jobs. (See the linked discussion).

OTOH, when I had a Bad Moment and had her use emacs/mutt for email, she
damn near killed me.  Sigh. She's a GUI gal.
