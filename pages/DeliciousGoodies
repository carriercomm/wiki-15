I've recently (re)discovered [[http://del.icio.us/ del.icio.us]]. It's really quite amazing. I'm not sure what to say about it, except that I have a sense that I might ''finally'' be able to have a place to put my bookmarks and not feel lost or overwhelmed by them.

I encourage everyone to check it out! You're free to take a look at [[http://del.icio.us/nimblemachines my bookmarks]], and to copy them (or subscribe to them) at will.

Enjoy!
