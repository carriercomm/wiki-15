I want to make a distinction here between critical things that ''must'' be done ''before'' a first "release", and things which I definitely want to have (ie, ''not'' "blue sky") but which can be put off until after a first launch/release.

Mostly the critical things have to do with the stability of the markup: I don't want to change that after a lot of content has been generated.

= Critical

finalize linking features and link markup

finalize markup in general

implement all linking features

preformatted text needs to be left entirely alone. '''Done!'''

re-implement list rendering

figure out a better way to parse/split the input

add inline images (basically done - markup could still change though)

use something other than double double-quotes for an "escape" character. (Or, once again, make pre immune to double double-quote removal.) I haven't changed using ddq as escape, but pre is immune to ddq removal.

= After launch

add ability to upload and display arbitrary documents, or at least decide if this is useful

figure out a good way to store backwards diffs and file metadata (see PageMetaData for some ideas on this)

implement diff, revision display, revision restore

tweak the CSS design

add SisterSites function

add blog integration

RSS feed

RFC links (easy enough to add before launch)

ISBN links (a bit more involved...)

table of contents at top of page, based on headings?
