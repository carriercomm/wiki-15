I gather this must have been a busy interesting summer for all concerned.

Hey! Where did you go? Come on back! The coast is clear.

''Cool.  Thanks for implementing the changes.  It's an issue which has always bugged me about the c2 wiki and some of the others.  I see you've also implemented another feature we discussed last night.''

''RE: Nimble running on yaws.  I'll redeploy when we get the markup and other issues nailed down.  Maybe by then I'll have v1 of TheUniversalTranslator running.  There's a mildly broken and kludgy version running on zog which
I hope to beat into shape this weekend.''

(''Ok, so I lied.  [[http://anarchitech.org/nimblewiki/wiki.cgi It's back up]] but not up to date.'')

I'd love to see your NeddySeagoon page again, too, esp if we can put up a hi-res pic of Aquarius to link to.

''Jimbo, um, "loaned" me a copy of an abbreviated version of a famous image
manipulation pogrom. I'll see if it can do anything with it. OTW I'll send it WildBill.''

Amusingly, the code to do the "voices" is about 15 lines of Perl, 30 or so of  CSS, and maybe an hour's time. I think the results are definitely worth that modest effort, if not a lot more! --DavidFrech
