[[http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI Cool URIs don't change]] is a must-read. When I read it, way back when, it forever changed how I look at the Web. It's the main reason I never want to see "cgi-bin" or ".html" in a URI!

''Or .yaws ;-)''

Indeed. But I don't know if it's possible to make such things go away under yaws.

There are a few notes in ApacheServerIssues relating to making spiffy URIs possible under Apache. On this wiki I do all the magic in .htaccess files. Here is wiki/.htaccess:

  DirectoryIndex wiki
  Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks

  <Files wiki>
    SetHandler cgi-script
  </Files>

The first line says: if someone requests the URI /wiki/, give them /wiki/wiki (remember that this wiki runs in the wiki/ directory of nimblemachines.com).

The options line makes running CGI scripts possible, and allows symlinks.

The files line says /wiki/wiki is really a CGI script.

There is another .htaccess file in wiki/images:

  DirectoryIndex none
  Options MultiViews

This tries to prevent showing the directory, and MultiViews turns on [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/content-negotiation.html content negotiation]]. This allows us to request, eg, /wiki/images/valid-css and have the server return to us the file wiki/images/valid-css.png, with MIME type image/png.
