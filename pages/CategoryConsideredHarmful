In March 1968 the Communications of the ACM (CACM) published computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra's seminal letter [[http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/ Go To Statement Considered Harmful]]. Seminal not only because it "kicked off" quite a discussion about structured programming, but also because it created a trend of semi-ironic, tongue-in-cheek articles about "X considered harmful", including when  X is "considered harmful".

CategoryConsideredHarmful seemed like a good place to collect all the semi-ironic or tongue-in-cheek entries on this wiki about Harmful Things.
