Doug's CIN (crazy idea number) 2,339.5

This spawned out of a brief exchange David and I had on the current implementation of this wiki over on   [[http://anarchitech.org/nimblewiki/wiki.cgi Anarchitech]].  I'm testing
out various wiki/blog engines with the YawsServer and I need a program to reflect content between those engines, ie automagically display the same content on all engines, try them all out and use whichever one you like best.

I recently discovered Ruby, so as a way of familiarizing myself with this very cool language (and because, for weird, deep seated psychological reasons
I ''hate'' Perl) I decided to use it to write TUT.  I have the first part
done which strips the strange binary info out of the wob files and deprecates
the history of the page (all past versions/edits are in the wob files as well).  I'm minorly hung up on getting rid of a spurious bit of garbage at the "end" of the file, largely due to my lack of familiarity w/ Ruby and the fact that I only get moments to work on this thing.

I'll listen to any thoughts, ideas, criticisms or suggestions anyone has; in
fact, maybe you know of a pogrom out there which does what I want that I can shamelessly steal.

Ahem.  So, now David comes through with PythonVsRuby and makes me rethink my
original decision, which is good at this stage. ;-)

Oh, merde, maybe I'll just go sailing. ;-)

Say, what about VisualBasic?  Now ''there's'' a language!
