The usual markup suspects.

>>

Can you be more specific?

>

Don't like the link markup.

>>

Why not? What ''specifically'' is wrong with it?

>

Dislike typing four brackets.  Would rather have links automagically created by inclusion of http:// and reserve
single brackets for hrefs.

Display images?  Or are you going for text only?

>>

This will change. There will be a way to display images: at the very least, images hosted elsewhere.

>

Deprecate the parsing of raw markup into paragraphs separated by
newlines thing.

>>

Yeah yeah.

RandyThelen asks that the Wiki syntax be listed on the Editing pages.  As it stands, when I'm editing text, I open a second browser window to review the Wiki syntax.

>>

This is a good idea. The original wiki had something like this. The trick is to make it short and sweet so it's not in the way. -- DavidFrech

>

----

RandyThelen asks that a 'preview' button be provided.  That feature would create a page with the edited Wiki on the top and the editor (as it stands, possibly with the syntax rules as requested above) below.  With this feature, I wouldn't have to submit my change before determining that I had used the wrong number of apostrophes for '''bold''' or ''italic''.

>>

I thought about this. But really are these two scenarios different?

(1) Edit a page, press save. The rendered page is shown. If wrong, you press edit again. (current behavior)

(2) Edit a page, press preview. The rendered page is shown. If correct, press save. Otherwise, back up and try again. (the "requested" behavior).

I think the current behavior is the simplest and most streamlined. -- DavidFrech

Update: as of 2005 January 28 15:12, it is possible to use Save to make initial save ("preview"). If it's right, you're done. If not, re-edit, but use Tweak to save further changes (so that only one log entry is made in RecentChanges.) --DavidFrech

>>>

You're putting the onus on the user to remember the difference between Tweak and Save.  It seems to be a bit of a speed bump. --DouglasShacteau

>>

Are you saying that even in the presence of the instructions on the edit page that something is still confusing?

>>>

Gasp! We read instructions around here?!  I thought it was just a case of
''Just type *make* and run the damn thing!'' ;-)

Seriously, I'm just anticipating whining from users.  I ''like'' tweak, and
I want it to stay.  It's cute.

RFC nnnn (or rfc nnnn) should create a link to ietf.org RFC document.

ISBN nnnn (or isbn nnnn) should create a link to, say, amazon.com. nnnn can contain dashes and underscores.

How do you delete a file? Or rename it?

>>

If it's those of us in group scientists we ssh in and rm the bugger.

>

Here's a thought: You save the file with an empty edit area. When it goes to show the file, it sees that the file exists, but is empty. It asks, somehow: this page exists, but is empty. Do you want to delete it? --DavidFrech

>>

The [[http://erlang.sics.se/wiki.html Original Flavor]] erlang wiki wrestled with the issue of deletion -- and came up with password protected
pages w/ comment areas.  A delete page function makes WikiWipeout easier for malicious users.  The above "file empty" method would slow them down
a little. Another option is to have an "I'd like to delete this page"
button which sends an email to one of the site admins, who could then
deal with the problem manually.  Or, perhaps the SA could check into an auth/ssl protected AdminPage.  We could have an area there for running 
a limited number of admin tasks, like ''Delete Pagename'', ''Block IP'' or
what have you.

OTOH, religious archiving to recover from WikiWipeout or MaliciousDeletion
would cover our bases for any flavor of ''Delete Pagename''.  (And in that
case a simple ''Delete Pagename'' button would be easiest.)

SiteAdminPage -- God forbid that any of us should be deprived of the ability to ssh in, but on the off chance, what about a SiteAdminPage?  Could be ssl/auth protected and would have the ability to interactively execute a restricted (ie unable to cause the whole site to go tango uniform) tasks.  (OTOH maybe I should just use my "NetBSD on a stick.") --DouglasShacteau

----

What's the current fantasy regarding an ''All Pages'' page (similar to
yaws wiki.)  Reviewing past log files from klee I found that this page gets
hit alot. -- DouglasShacteau

>>

What do you mean by an All Pages page?

>

A listing of every freaking page on the wiki; think "Directory".  [[http://pub.cozmixng.org/~the-rwiki/rw-cgi.rb?cmd=view;name=RWiki+directory Rwiki]] does this as well.

>>

There is a way to do this now, though it's non-obvious. The search page actually uses regular expressions, so if you search page names for ".*" you will get a list of all pages. --DavidFrech

>

I figured that out; but my vote is always for the obvious when it comes to your userbase. --DouglasShacteau

----

Do we want to do an RSS feed? --DouglasShacteau

>>

Absolutely. Other fish to fry first...like getting link format hammered out, figuring out how to do lists, fixing (maybe) the double-newline thing, and making versioning actually work. ;-)

>

----

The "Comment about changes you made:" section -- I usually ignore (or forget about it.)  I'm thinking it's a bit superfluous to have both it and Tweak.  A Change is a Change and worthy of attention, a Tweak is a Tweak.
--DouglasShacteau

>>

True, but there is no way to know ahead of time whether the user is going to push Tweak or Save, so I have to have the comment field regardless.

>

Really?  The current default message is "Ignore this for now".  If I hit Save without changing it, it's logged in RecentChanges but won't you perceive the change as of any importance due to this default message.  I guess I feel it's just one more thing for the user to keep track and comes
close to violating the DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork principle.

It seems redundant to make a comment about changes.  Perhaps instead we could have a button called "Diff" or "Changes" at the top of each page which highlights the changes from the last edit.  Then it's IOTTMCO.

--DouglasShacteau

>>

I think the idea of the comment box is to put there the ''intent'' of your changes - like a CVS log entry.

What's funny is that I put the "ignore this for now" message as an instruction to the ''user'' to ignore the comment box, ''not'' an instruction to the save code to ignore the changes made. The LocusOfMeaning ''is'' a complicated affair. ;-)

>

Yes.  I am mindful of the aphorism: ''When you *assume* you make an *ass* out of *u* and *me*.'' ;-)

----

Do we want to include other media?  Thinking of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Wiki_markup Wikipedia's media link]].

>>

I don't understand this. It seems like you only two classes of HTTP links: '''img''' and '''a'''. The second class contains all links to resources external to the page, such as another HTML page, a large image, a sound file, etc. The MIME type that the HTTP server returns to the client should be enough info for the client to decide what to do with the resource: render it (HTML), show the image, play the sound, etc. Why they need a "media" link is beyond me. I think TimBL would be disappointed: after all, he didn't call URIs "universal" for nothing. ;-)

>

Perhaps they wanted to give users a visual cue that they were about to
follow a streaming media link?  A heads up to those on lower bandwidth
connections......

----

I have a strange idea for something useful to do with ISBN links (as with most of my good ideas, this was mostly stolen from Wikipedia). My idea is this: you put

  ISBN 1234567890

(see LinkMarkupNotes for other allowable formats) and a link is generated to a TemplatePage with the name "IsbnFinder" (or something). Into IsbnFinder is put a series of "query" links to resources, such as Amazon, Powell's, and many of the world's library catalogs, that can take an ISBN as part of a query. When the link to IsbnFinder is followed (which contains "&isbn=1234567890" as part of its URI) - because it is a TemplatePage - IsbnFinder renders with the ISBN number from the query ''filled in'' in all of the query links that make up the page. Thus, you can now follows tens, or hundreds, of links that look up your book for you, at online bookstores and at the libraries of the world. --DavidFrech

>>

There is already a web site like your IsbnFinder: [[http://isbn.nu/]]. See LinkMarkupNotes for more. --MichaelPruemm

----

It would be nice to have a way to hilight the changes in the last 24 hours or may be even a configurable timespan (via cookie?). --MichaelPruemm

>>

Funny that you should say that. I was just thinking of adding something like that, but my version was going to be dead simple and not as useful as what you're suggesting. I was thinking that on each ''save'' that the script could do a diff between the existing page and the edited text you are saving, and highlight the new that way. Unfortunately, the next edit (sometimes only 1m later, a Tweak ;-) would wipe out those changes. So this requires a bit of thought, but would definitely be useful.

OTOH, having a "diff" link would serve the purpose, and be more general, of showing changes since last revision, the one before that, etc. I used to render the "last edited ..." text as a link to the wiki script to run a (non-existent) "diff" action, but following the link generated ominous Server Error messages, so I disabled it Until Further Notice. I think this is the right solution, but there are some roadblocks to run our tanks thru before we get there. --DavidFrech

>>>

Curiosity killed the cat.  What '''kind''' of ominous Server Error messages?

>>

See your notes on PestControl. The date link was a link to the "diff" action. --DavidFrech

Related idea: as a way of differentiating between people's posts in ThreadMode, allow the choice of a color for any edit. What could happen is that all changes (based on a diff between the existing version and the one being saved) be set off in a div with a different color.

Another idea: extend what we're already doing, which is to use italic by surrounding alternate edits with two apostrophes. What about using markup that is specifically to identify the speaker; it could be nested two, three, four, or even five times, and each would render as a different color.

As a concrete example:

  Initial post.

   ((First response.))

   Rebuttal.

   ((Second response.))

   (((A third voice chimes in.)))

etc.

--DavidFrech

>

Hm, that sounds interesting. I would like to try that... If you set me up on your machine, I would give it a try. What do you need? --MichaelPruemm

>>

Thinking a bit more about this, I realize that I got the markup wrong. I suggested using ''inline'' markup, but it should really be ''block'' markup. (It will be rendered as a div element whose class will determine the foreground/background color rendered.)

I think a better idea would be something like (think of email):

  >

for the first "voice",

  >>

for the second, etc. This could nest almost arbitrarily deeply. Having up to eight or so voices (colors) might be nice.

I prefer this to the inline

  ((((((((I'm the eighth voice. Can't you count the parens?))))))))

esp when you get lots of parens. Without emacs to help you match them, it would be a nightmare.

Whereas

  >>>>>>>>

  I'm the eighth voice.

  >>>>>

   I'm the fifth.

seems much more manageable. The line of '>' characters acts more like an hrule ('----'), but one that is parameterizable. The color sticks until changed back to normal, perhaps with a single '>'.

--DavidFrech

>

I like this markup. So, a voice stays in effect until changed to another voice?

>>

Yes.

>

And the original, "black" text is voice 1, marked with a single

  >

like this?

>>

Yes.

>

Once we  have picked a voice in a conversation, do we still sign every contribution?

>>

I don't know. I suppose if it's a series of rather short things bounced back and forth, it'll remain clear who is "speaking", but if things become long or there are several people, it might be nice to still sign things.

>

----

I've made this change, and here it is showcased on this page. Thoughts? It's a little strange, but works relatively well. Given how I'm always resetting to '>' before an hrule, maybe I ''should'' make that automatic.

>>

That's probably a good idea. And reset it on headings, too. Even if that breaks Randy's example. Sorry, Randy. --MichaelPruemm

>

And is changing the signature link color the right thing to do? It looked funny leaving it as is (ie, normal link color). Sometimes now it looks funny being the same color as the rest of the text. Hmmm.

--DavidFrech

>>

Another option would be changing the background color of the <div>. Might be a bit heavy, though. --MichaelPruemm

>

Yeah. Thought about that. It's easy to tweak the CSS.

Another thing. I keep wanting to type:

  >> This is me talking now.
  >  This is you talking.

I think when I fix the markup parsing I'll try to achieve this. --DavidFrech

>>>

Hmmm, this is interesting, isn't it.  Glad we had that phone chat last night. ;-)

--DouglasShacteau

>

Is that a vote of confidence? ;-) I like the result, a lot.

>> Mais oui. :-)  Of course, with one small caveat.  I think we should keep
our signature link colors the default blue/red.  Reasoning: Unless we assign each user a color (which would prob require a cookie or user login for editing), if a page has several different threads to the conversation the user might find their hierarchy change dependent on when they join
the conversation.  For example, my response above was as the third voice.
here I'm responding to your query as the second.  If a user sees a color
associated with a signature link, the assumption is that the all green text
belongs to Michael, for instance, or all Happy Pink (magenta) belongs to
Douglas.   Personally, I find that the default signature link color(s), as strange as their juxtaposition may look to some, help visually establish
the author of the comment.
