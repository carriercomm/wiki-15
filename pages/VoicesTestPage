I took a chunk of another page and randomly assigned a voice to each paragraph. This is what it looks like:

----

What's the current fantasy regarding an ''All Pages'' page (similar to
yaws wiki.)  Reviewing past log files from klee I found that this page gets
hit alot. -- DouglasShacteau

>>

What do you mean by an All Pages page?

>

A listing of every freaking page on the wiki; think "Directory".  [[http://pub.cozmixng.org/~the-rwiki/rw-cgi.rb?cmd=view;name=RWiki+directory Rwiki]] does this as well.

>>>

There is a way to do this now, though it's non-obvious. The search page actually uses regular expressions, so if you search page names for ".*" you will get a list of all pages. --DavidFrech

>>>>

I figured that out; but my vote is always for the obvious when it comes to your userbase. --DouglasShacteau

>>>>>

Do we want to do an RSS feed? --DouglasShacteau

>>

Absolutely. Other fish to fry first...like getting link format hammered out, figuring out how to do lists, fixing (maybe) the double-newline thing, and making versioning actually work. ;-)

>>>>>>

The "Comment about changes you made:" section -- I usually ignore (or forget about it.)  I'm thinking it's a bit superfluous to have both it and Tweak.  A Change is a Change and worthy of attention, a Tweak is a Tweak.
--DouglasShacteau

>

True, but there is no way to know ahead of time whether the user is going to push Tweak or Save, so I have to have the comment field regardless.

>>>

Really?  The current default message is "Ignore this for now".  If I hit Save without changing it, it's logged in RecentChanges but won't you perceive the change as of any importance due to this default message.  I guess I feel it's just one more thing for the user to keep track and comes
close to violating the DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork principle.

>>>>

It seems redundant to make a comment about changes.  Perhaps instead we
could have a button called "Diff" or "Changes" at the top of each page which highlights the changes from the last edit.  Then it's IOTTMCO.

--DouglasShacteau

I think the idea of the comment box is to put there the ''intent'' of your changes - like a CVS log entry.

What's funny is that I put the "ignore this for now" message as an instruction to the ''user'' to ignore the comment box, ''not'' an instruction to the save code to ignore the changes made. The LocusOfMeaning ''is'' a complicated affair. ;-)

>>

Yes.  I am mindful of the aphorism: ''When you *assume* you make an *ass* out of *u* and *me*.'' ;-)
