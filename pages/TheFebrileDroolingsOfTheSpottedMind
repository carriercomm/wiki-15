Somebody posted a note about [[http://factor.sourceforge.net/ Factor]] on the
[[http://anarchitech.org/wiki/showPage.yaw?node=Forth anarchitech wiki]]. It
looks interesting.  I'm unfamiliar with the [[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy/synops.html Joy Language]]
and curious if anyone here has had any exposure to or experience with
[[http://factor.sourceforge.net/wiki/ Concatenative Languages]] -- other than
Forth. ;-)

Hm, I wouldn't say "experience" but I have been following the [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/concatenative/ Concatenative Languages mailing list]] for a while. Sometimes it's quite interesting. Of course, Factor was described there, first. --MichaelPruemm

Alas, mynamenotes just didn't soar for me, darn it, but probably because I've spent most of this week ranting and raving with our dear friend [[http://www.jefftobis.com Jeff Tobis]], the above just exploded forth like lily-white love in a desert dust-devil.  

Today's yippee-skippy:  hacked the silly yaws wiki so that it [[http://anarchitech.org/wiki/showPage.yaws?node=home validates]] as XHTML 1.0 Strict. It ain't perfect, but Extra Crispy is better than Original Flavor. ;-)

And now for something completely different.
