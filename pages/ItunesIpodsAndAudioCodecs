Last week I used - intensively - an iMac for the first time. I was impressed with certain things (iTunes was slick and mostly worked) and unimpressed with others (Mail had subtle bugs relating to using IMAP folders).

An inveterate critic, I came away disappointed. I had wanted to really ''love'' this machine. It had cool things I thought I wanted: BSD under the hood, GarageBand, a groovy user interface... And yet something spoiled it for me.

I thought about this later and realized what it was: '''Apple has sold out the Open Source community''', at least where audio software is concerned.

Why do I claim this?

It helps to step back a bit. In September 1998, [[http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/amm/ Fraunhofer IIS]] sent a "letter of infringement" to several open-source [[WikiPedia:MP3 MP3]]-related projects, sending an immediate chill through that community. Like the [[WikiPedia:GIF GIF]] image format, it was clear that MP3 was going to be a software patent battleground.

Immediately thereafter [[http://www.xiph.org/about.html xiph.org]] was founded to develop free, open source audio (and now video) codecs that everyone could use (and sell!) without fear of patent infringement.

In parallel with this, the [[WikiPedia:MPEG MPEG]] developed a new non-free codec, the so-called "Advanced Audio Codec" ([[WikiPedia:AAC AAC]]), designed to be a higher-quality replacement for MP3. xiph.org's free [[http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ Ogg Vorbis]] codec is AAC's main competition.

Given this bit of background, which high-quality codec do you think Apple chose for the iPod, the iTunes software (when importing, or "ripping", songs from CD), and the iTunes store?

That's right: AAC. They had an awesome opportunity to support an open-source audio project that is critically-important in the fight against corporate control of media, and they failed. Given the huge popularity of iPods & iTunes this would have been a huge boon to Ogg Vorbis. Apple may instead have sounded its death knell.

I consider this a crime, and evil. --DavidFrech

Death to Apple!  Umm, as an aside, how often is content "reflected" onto
the public wiki?  I wanted to link to the public version of this page
from the anarchitech site, but it wasn't there yet.  So, I took the liberty
of liberating it, but will redirect to nimblepublic when the page is available.

All pages on the public wiki, with the single exception of RecentChanges, are symlinks to editable ones, so changes should appear immediately. Just browse [[http://nimblemachines.com/browse?show=ItunesIpodsAndAudioCodecs]] to see it.
You should be able to get there from [[http://nimblemachines.com/browse?show=RecentChanges]] as well. --DavidFrech

Ack.  Pilot error. Forgot the browse? and used wiki?  Nivvermynd.

The epilogue to this story is that my parents returned their iMac to Apple. All the music we had "ripped" from CD - a gigabyte! - I copied to my mom's Windows laptop (via Samba) and discovered that she can can do everything from RealPlayer 10 that she could do with iTunes.

I think my next step (um, so to speak ;-) is to set her up on a Linux box, maybe running something drool-proof like RedHat Fedora. The Mac was going to solve the issues of (1) reliability, (2) hardness-of-use, and (3) parasite hosting that plague Windows. Linux can do at least as well on all of these, and the hardware is 50% the price of Apple's. Plus, she can run '''fanless''' and '''diskless'''...
