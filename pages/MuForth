I wrote a Forth called muFORTH, to explore some implementation techniques (a simple native code compiler for the x86, tail recursion), and the idea of building a small kernel, with just enough bits in it to bootstrap itself, by loading more Forth code from source.

I sort of succeeded.

But right now muFORTH is in limbo. I was translating it, with RandyThelen's help - to run on PowerPC Macs - by converting to threaded code. This project stalled, and I got depressed, and it's been sitting since then.

If you're interested in the ideas, read the MuForthReadme, and the MuForthStartup (the Forth text that is loaded to extend the interpreter to be a usable system), and if you would like to talk about the project, please [[mailto:wiki@nimblemachines.com email]] me!

I'm now keeping a MuForthDiary about my progress.

The code is in a [[http://subversion.tigris.org Subversion]] [[http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/ repository]] with anonymous read-only access. You can [[http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/ browse it]], or, using a Subversion client, you can check out a local copy. There are three versions of interest.

Browse the source of

* [[http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/trunk/ trunk]]: my threaded version - currently under active development;

* [[http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/branches/x86_native/ branches/x86_native]]: the original x86 compiler version;

* [[http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/branches/rthelen/ branches/rthelen]]: RandyThelen's threaded-code version.

Or, using a Subversion client, check out the source locally (try one of the following):

  svn co http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/trunk <local-name>
  svn co http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/branches/x86_native <local-name>
  svn co http://svn.nimblemachines.com/muforth/branches/rthelen <local-name>

Another of my reasons for writing muFORTH was to replace the home-grown Forth (dforth) that I had been using to do target compilation (for embedded control applications). I'm ''very'' interested in writing a target compiler, hosted on muFORTH, for the ArmArchitecture. I've done much of the work already; you can [[http://svn.nimblemachines.com/target-arm/
browse it here]], or check out a copy:

  svn co http://svn.nimblemachines.com/target-arm <local-name>
