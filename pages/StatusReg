Actually fStatusReg.  This page is the result of an UnintentionallyCreatedLinkName from the diff display of the Sx52ForthCpu page.  

Note that this error does not appear in the "normal" display of the page, just the diff display (last edited date link).

 fStatusReg (see? pre doesn't link from display page.  Now view diff....)

Vewy baaaaaaaaad.  Sample code in pre sections should not form links.

Thanks for the "bug report". I was able to reproduce it as described above. The fix was easy and affected only a single regular expression. If you try now, you'll notice it is fixed already in the running version of the wiki. CVS was updated, too. --MichaelPruemm

But the real problem is somewhere else. As you can see on the first line above (and here again), fStatusReg forms a link too, '''from a partial word'''. I don't think this is intended.
