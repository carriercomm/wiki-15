A quick thought.

Right now it is possible to visit the wiki via two scripts: wiki and browse. (Really they are same; browse is a symlink to wiki.)

When rendering a page the wiki script looks to see if the script name matches the variable "$editscript". If so, it allows editing, by putting edit links at the bottom of the page.

Since "browse" mode will not have edit links, the wiki becomes more like a "normal" (readonly) web site. ([[browse?show=WikiAsBlog Browse this page]] to see how this works.) How can we encourage feedback, without allowing the unwashed to defile our pages? My thought was to add in the footer, in browse mode, a "comment" link. It goes to a page very much like the edit page, but it's basically an append-only deal, like on the yaws wiki.

Since everyone is fighting "wiki spam" (people putting URI links to their stupid sites so their Google page rank will go up) we could simply filter out URIs from comments, and put a note there that would-be spammers shouldn't bother.

Thoughts?

Are we thinking of reflecting this content to a public version that runs in browse mode?  Ipso, then the comment append area is a definite win.

However, I don't like excluding URI's from comment areas if we go the WikiAsBlog route.  Honestly, I'd rather be clever about this with scripts and filters and keep everything more or less open.

One way to do this would be to have a script running which greps Pages for http://.  ScannerScript mails one or more FearlessVolunteers the info (I hereby volunteer) to review it and check the pages to see if it's spam.  If spam, we grab their ip and send their site admin a NastyGram and then block access from that ip.  Or we could roll this into a BayesianFilter; I think we talked about doing this at one point on anarch (which
has never been spammed because most pages are locked and robots are disallowed from executing '''e d i t P a g e . y a w s.''' (A good argument for breaking the action bits of the code into modules.)

In fact, this might be a way to handle the AutomagicSpammers here. ;-)

How are those of us in group sci connecting?  I'm accessing from all
over the place, so if we did the content reflection thang, those of us in similar circumstances would need a way to declare our dynamip and get shunted into EditAllowedMode.  Perhaps something like our EvilTwinHack.
