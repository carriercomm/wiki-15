The esteemed author of this lousy wiki engine. But who knew I was also a [[http://davidfrech.com/ famous sculptor]]?

It's now possible to [[mailto:wiki@nimblemachines.com email]] me. For those of you who wanted to contact me, but previously couldn't.

See DavidsNotes for ideas about what he thinks is right and wrong about this wiki.

Is this a real wiki or a walled garden?  At present there are two main contributors: yourself and MichaelPruemm.  IIRC the "live" address isn't indexed.  If you're starting to get more hits in the logs, it might be time to open the door.  OTOH, perhaps you'd rather keep the heathens at bay. ;-)

I would say it's ''not'' a walled garden, since there are heaps of outward links.

OTOH, I never really intended it as a wiki... More as a soapbox (you know, the way a ''blog'' is ;-). Its current wiki nature is to allow the small-scale collaboration among me, you (AnonymousCoward that you are), and MichaelPruemm, to build the technology.

Oh, c'mon, you knew it was NeddySeagoon.

I may change my mind about this and fling open the doors, but I would not do this until the wiki engine has better support for versioning. --DavidFrech
