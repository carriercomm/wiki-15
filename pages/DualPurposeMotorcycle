= aka Enduro or Dual Sport motorcycle

When I was fifteen or so, I fell in love with a then-new Honda motorcycle: the XL250 (it is no longer made). At the time it was full of innovative technology: a big 23in front wheel, engine counterbalancers to reduce vibration (this is a one-cylinder engine - a "thumper" - after all), etc. Cycle World loved it. So did I. I used to lie on our blue bean-bag chair listening to Deep Purple's album ''Machine Head'' and fantasizing about zipping around on my big red bike. Going anywhere I wanted.

My brother was the one who realized the motorcycle fantasy. He got a blue Honda CB360 twin, then a green Honda CB550K (four-cylinder), then a full-dress 60s Harley, then a newer red Harley FXSB (in 1985). He is now sort of motorcycle-free: his "dresser" is in pieces, in boxes in his garage.

Maybe now it's my turn. I'm looking at the [[http://kawasaki.com/html/motorcycles/mc_frame.asp Kawasaki]] [[http://kawasaki.com/html/motorcycles/dual/klr650_menu.asp KLR650]]. (I would link directly to the page, but because of their lame use of frames, I cannot. I linked to the sidebar menu.) Some pics:

-- Note about these pics. I've copied them locally (into photos/), prefixing the names with the year and model of the bike. If these images ever go away, we can start serving the local copies; but I don't want to do that until I have to. They are also checked in to svn.

It'll go anywhere and do almost anything. People have ridden these things across continents - including [[http://dreamers1.com/russia/Practicalities/Russian_Trip_Report.htm riding "the Road"]] - a 2200km length of road-in-process in Russia that has been known to destroy vehicles that attempt it.

Suzuki make a similar bike, but it lacks the water-cooled engine, rear rack,  and large fuel tank of the KLR. Suzuki's DR650 looks like this:

Cool looking bikes, no?

If you like rice burners. ;-)

Unfortunately, the last time I saw one of these was on I-5.  It had attempted to interface with two large Army trucks, and the bike, luggage
and bits of the rider were smeared over a several hundred foot long swath
across all four lanes.  In fact, the resultant traffic jam (N-bound backed
up from Ft. Lewis to past the Nisqually bridge/hill) was the deciding factor in our decision to "just have the baby in Olympia."

I think motorcycles are great; I myself have wanted a Sportster for years.
However, motorists are stupid, congestion is horrible up here, and it rains all the time.  If I was living out in the desert in Nevada I'd probably get
one; O-town/SEA/PDX -- forget it.

As an aside: do you remember that [[http://www.postdiluvian.org/~mason/moto/SR500/ SR500]] Chris had rotting away in the yard
of the cottage in Wallingford?  That was a fun bike (while it was still
alive.)

You're a cheerful sort. Just ''try'' to rain on my parade!

Sportster. Hah!

>>

Hmmm, didn't mean to ''rain'' on your parade.  It just bothers me that
A) motorcycles are so cool and B) motorists are so stupid.  However, I should note that in the above case the biker was at fault.  And truth
be told, that SR500 was in many respects cooler than a Spudster.  Sounded
like a B-52 on takeoff.  Personally, I think you should find an old KLR250
or similar [[http://www.thumperpage.com/ Thumper]].  They drool cool, baby.

The KLR650 ''is'' a thumper. All the true dual-purpose bikes are. There are BMW twins and a Suzuki twin (the DL650 V-strom), and in Europe the Kawasaki KLE500 (a DP version of the venerable EX500 "Ninja"), that claim to be DP bikes, but all the really go-anywhere bikes are thumpers.

The KLR650 is just a bigger and badder version of the KLR250. Its gas tank is about 20 time bigger than the 250's, so you can actually go places. It's faster on the freeway (and therefore safer), and it's not ''that'' much heavier than the 250. Trust me, I checked. Remember: it was a Honda ''250'' that I was drooling over in my youth. ;-)

Ok, I'll take your word for it.  :-)

Umm, can you rig a sidecar?  ;)

Check out the [[http://www.advrider.com/ Adventure Rider]] discussion site. It's heavily focussed on the BMWs (650/1150/1200GS), but they have an active [[http://www.advrider.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15 Thumpers]] forum as well. And, to clarify, the BMW 650GS is itself a thumper. ;-)

There is also a [[http://klr650.net/ KLR650 discussion site]]. And to add even ''more'' excitement to the world of Thumpers, there is the supermotard craze. Check this out:

Two examples of the "supermotard" - basically a dirt racing bike with street tires on smaller (street-sized) wheels. Apparently hella fun: light, nimble, drive over curbs, etc. Urban assault vehicles. Of course, the KTM directly above is ''not'' street legal, lacking lights and mirrors. Apparently you can turn a KLR into a nice motard...

Well, it sure as hell isn't a DPM, but check out [[http://anarchitech.org/wiki/showPage.yaws?node=SelematDjalan Don Pettit's Big Dawg]]. Beaucoup zorkmids spent on this thing.
