I was going to call this "HTML considered harmful" but not only would that be woefully clich!!eacute!!d, but it's not really what I mean. Template designers and people writing XML-to-HTML converters (for instance) ''need'' to write HTML. But most people - especially authors - shouldn't.

I'm not being condescending. A lot of people are perfectly capable of learning HTML. I'm saying that I think that writing in HTML is a mistake because it's too "low-level". It's about how to display things rather than what they mean (though it has gotten better).

One of the reasons it has taken me a long time to "get going" on putting my thoughts online was that I knew I wanted to write in something other than HTML. I knew HTML was going to morph and change, and, being a programmer, I considered it "object code" - something that is generated automatically by a compiler, from some higher-level description. This is especially nice when the format of the object code is a moving target. You simply update the compiler and recompile all your pages.

Writing in object code is something I did in 1976 when keying tiny 6800 programs (in hexadecimal!) into an evaluation board; it doesn't make sense any more, but it was a lot of fun!

Since I spent a lot of time thinking about my "ideal HTML compiler" and researching how others were solving this problem I didn't write much HTML, and, consequently, my Web projects languished.

I have since discovered XML and wiki markup. Both have their appeal, but they are suited for different things. An XML DTD like [[http://docbook.org/ DocBook]] is great for writing books and other complex documents with lots of hierarchic structure and diagrams and so on. Wiki markup is great for day-to-day jotting. I think some flavor of wiki markup would be great for blogging, and in fact that is what I plan to do with my wiki engine.
