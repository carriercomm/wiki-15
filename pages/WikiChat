WikiChat! The most marvelous thing to hit NimbleWiki since Voices!

# Live chat w/ ''n'' users
# Ability to archive chat if things get really interesting (as opposed to just foaming.)
# WikiWords created in chat session create pages.  WikiWords or other links
ref'ed in chat session "work".

Now taking bids.  Perhaps a nice project for Python, or do we hack talkd?

Or is this just really, really silly and a complete waste of time?
