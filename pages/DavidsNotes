Thinking again what would be a GoodFirstMotorcycle. Mostly I found some nice pictures of the Kawasaki Ninja 500R (aka EX500R) and wanted a place to put them.

Made a wikified copy of Neal Stephenson's InTheBeginningWasTheCommandLine. The original .zip file is available [[http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html here]].

A (dumbish) idea: a LatestPix page! There you can find a flickr badge with my latest pix, should I ever either:

# get in the habit of taking pictures and uploading them regularly; or

# get a camera phone, and take & upload pictures regularly.

;-)

Looking at my weblogs. Wow! People are actually finding the site on Google! A few people searched for Rivendell Bicycle Works, for "klr motard", for "dual-purpose motorcycle", and for "muforth" and found me! Cool!

In particular I wanted to put up a MuForth page so that I could mention the program there, and solicit comments.

Adding markup for obfuscated ''mailto'' links. Like so:

  [[mailto:johndoe@example.com email me]]

renders as [[mailto:johndoe@example.com email me]]. The link text is necessary, and should be something other than your email address!

I added this as a way for people to contact me thru the wiki.

After the relative pain of adding the flickr markup to the wiki codebase - Perl bites! - I'm thinking again, seriously, of rewriting this beast in a nicer language, and one that I would enjoy more. The main contenders, as usual, are:

* Python

* OCaml

* Haskell

It  would be a good learning experience, the same way that writing this wiki helped me learn (and learn to ''hate'') Perl.

Trying out my flickr badge experiment:

[flickr]

I tried to put the images on a colored background, but I was unable to get it to style properly. Either the band of color was a little strip (the height, interestingly, of a line of ''text''), and was the right ''width'', or it was the right height (tall enough for the tallest image) but the width of the page.

It's not important - I think it looks nice without a background - but does anyone know how to style this (I tried wrapping in another div, but to no avail) to make this work?

''Amusing footnote.'' I changed the script to use public photos tagged with "nimble" and "machine". Guess what? In flickr's millions of photos, ''there isn't a single one'' tagged that way.

Added back the (ugly) validator buttons, and added a "Get Firefox" button.

Is this too ugly?

Just now I was chatting with MichaelPruemm about the idea of a language for FunctionalWebProgramming, so I thought I'd make a space for discussion.

I've moved some OldBlogEntries from my [[http://nimblemachines.blogspot.com/ blog]] on Blogger to the wiki. Enjoy.

Thinking about bicycles reminded me how much I appreciate the existence of companies like RivendellBicycleWorks. They are fad-free, down-to-earth, experienced, and opinionated (in a ''good'' way of course). They sell great stuff. They remind me that bicycling is about joy and freedom and not about bling bling.

In case everyone thinks I'm just a motorcycle freak, I should add that I also really like these CoolCityBicycles.

A week ago I fell victim to ScooterMania. I've since moved on. This week I've rekindled an affair with a very old flame: the DualPurposeMotorcycle.

Reading Wiki:WikiReadingHabits and realizing that we are not alone in having trouble deciding how to mark up changes in the text to make life easier for Wiki:RecentChangesJunkie""s.

Even though EightBitMicrocontrollersAreObsolete, I'm still interested in discussing their use and programming. See MicrocontrollerShootout for a rollicking conversation. To keep things fair & balanced, we're also talking about my architecture of choice: the ArmArchitecture.

I spent a ''lot'' of time in the last few days researching microcontrollers, and I discovered that something I had hoped for for years has finally come true: EightBitMicrocontrollersAreObsolete.

This past week, following the ImacDebacle, I went in search of ConvivialComputingHardware. Unfortunately, I haven't yet found what I'm looking for, but I'm emotionally and physically exhausted.

Smooshing together PageNames in a LinkSpace isn't working from a UI perspective.  Too easy to click on the wrong thing.  We either need an automagic feature or rely on WikiGnomes (like me.)  Reworking as above is one way to do it; could also use hr's, although their overuse should be
discouraged, IMHO.

''You missed an opportunity to group them thematically. ;-)''

''No, I'm lazy and they're '''your''' notes.'';-) ''OMT: I removed Return""Codes. BadPageName, sorry.  Doing too many things at once.''
----

explain intermap. add some more maps.

intermap should be a wiki page, so users can add to the mappings.

Also, intermap links should use the

  [[uri link text]]

form, so that the ugly details can be hidden, even though the mechanism is still there to assist the author.

----

pre text needs to be left entirely alone.

----

wiki engine code should be an editable page, if not a wiki page

lots of css work: space out the icon and the title. make things prettier in general.

explain the double newline thing. rethink it?

''Yes, please, rethink this.  It's very annoying.''

figure out friggin * and # so lists work again.

handle backwards diffs eventually. in the short term, maybe have a pages/archive dir with <name>.<time> (in ISO format) so at least we have a record of previous pages, esp if an editing conflict occurs.

normalize markup. standardize mostly on wikipedia markup? I like its flexibility, esp the methods for forming links. I'm less enamored these days of Wiki:CamelCase and Wiki:AccidentalLinking.

''Again, yes, that would be an improvement.''

page metadata: use rfc822-like headers? (the page proper starts after \n\n) this could be a place to put a revision number, among other things.

do something like sistersites? where the engine checks to see if a page with the same name exists on one or several sister sites; for each correspoing page it makes a link at the bottom of the page.

''Good idea.''

fix query strings. save action is oddball. how to make this clean?

''How about a Cancel button in addition to Save and Revert?''

That's what the back button is for. ;-) --DavidFrech

''But you're violating the ExpectationPrinciple.  I '''expect'''
to see a cancel button and not have to traverse the acreage to get to the bowser back button, esp if my cursor is already down
in this portion of screen.'' --DouglasShacteau

No, I meant the "back button" on your keyboard. It's much easier to reach than either of the other two. --DavidFrech

''Grrr, give me more credit than that.  My point is that you have
gui interfaces for '''save''' and '''revert'''.  I think some
might expect to see a '''cancel'''.'' --DouglasShacteau

Sorry, I forgot the smiley on that last comment. I suppose I could rename "Revert" to "Cancel". I think they do the same thing. Um, do they? Let me check...No, revert does what you would expect: after making changes in the edit window, revert undoes all the changes and returns to the state entered when initially editing the file, and leaves you in the editing interface. Let me see about making a Cancel button.

Does the yaws wiki edit page have a cancel button? The HTML definition of forms only has submit and revert actions built-in. In order to effect cancel from a button, I would have to submit the form but mark elsewhere that the intention is to throw away the edit. This seems complicated.

''yaws wiki has '''preview''', '''delete''', '''cancel''' and '''password''' on new pages.  Edit and edit-append regions are slightly different. ''

''Make the edit window wider?''

Maybe. How much wider? I like to read text-heavy pages in a fairly narrow window. People who lay out text for a living know that there is a maximum width before the eye gets lost following the horizontal, and it's not very wide - maybe 6.5in or so. Wider than that and you need multiple columnns.

I wanted the text edit window to fit nicely in a browser window that was narrowed for reading. I could widen it by ten or characters without trouble, though.

''Maybe 10 chars wider and bump the font size up?''

----

How to do Categories? like ward's wiki with backlinks? it works but it's a lot to type CategoryBicycling on every page about bicycling.

''Hmm, maybe separate text window (like "Comment about changes" at top of edit page where you type in category word and it displays:''
 
  Category::<your category>

''on save.'' --DouglasShacteau

I don't see how that is really ''less'' typing -- except for 8 letters. --MichaelPruemm

----

how are we heading toward wiki-blog integration?

''Been thinking about his lately (short version): do a "locked" page for author, comment area is the wiki, as opposed to append
only comment area of blog.'' -- DouglasShacteau

----

Um, by creating an interwiki link from NimbleWiki:YawsCgiHacks you opened the door to the free world. ;-)

''I hadn't thought of that. You're publicizing the NimbleWiki, right? (Which, for all the reasons I've mentioned elsewhere - alpha alpha alpha!! - might be premature...) Since that link was intended for your eyes only, perhaps it should self-destruct in five seconds...''

I took it upon myself to deprecate that, so, hushaboom, is gone.  Yeah, I know, it's alpha.  I *really* wanted to start running it ''live'' on yaws
though.  It's not "obviously" linked, except from Anarchitech:Announce and
Anarchitech:OtherWikis.  I figured if anybody checked it, it would be "just
an Erlanger" and except for Joe, they're by and large lurkers.  So I think
we're fine.
