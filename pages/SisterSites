SisterSites are, at the very least, wikis that use a similar linking structure (say, CamelCase), and have the possibility of addressing the same issues. Hence, there is the very real possibility that if I have created a page about the HaskellLanguage, that there is one at Wiki:HaskellLanguage. (There is, in fact, a Wiki:SisterSites page.)

A wiki engine can have this kind of linking built in. It complements InterMap. Here is how it works. When the wiki engine formats the HTML for a page, it also checks its SisterSites for a page with the same name. For each SisterSite for which the page exists, a link is created at the bottom of the page to the page on the SisterSite.

It's a simple but powerful idea, but I don't think I explained it all that well.

The implementation is going to require some "screen scraping" of generated HTML, since all the wikis I tested generate some kind of page (inviting you to create the new page) when the page you are trying to visit does not exist. So it will be, by necessity, somewhat fragile. If the HTML generated for non-existent pages changes, the linking might break.
