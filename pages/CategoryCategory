Since I like the elegance of it, and since I can't immediately think of a better way, I'm adopting the original wiki's approach to categories (see Wiki:CategoryCategory for more).

The basic idea is this: every Category has a page describing it. That page is  called "Category<subject>". Any page on the wiki that fits into that Category should have a link - on the bottom maybe - to Category<subject>.

Now, what makes all this work is that every page's title is a link that when followed causes a search of the wiki for pages that link back to it. So, to find all the pages about bicycling, go to CategoryBicycling and follow its title link. A page containing links to all pages containing links to CategoryBicycling will be displayed.

The category page itself links to ''this'' page: since it describes a Category, it is of type CategoryCategory. ;-)

This means that following the title link for ''this'' page will find all the Category pages, since they will, if written properly, link to CategoryCategory.

Hope that all made sense. --DavidFrech
