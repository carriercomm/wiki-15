cvs co'd the source, built locally on zog where we're running a hacked version of 1.49.  Initially no display, but changed following code:

  $webhamster = "webhamster@nimblemachines.com";

to

   $webhamster = "webhamster\@nimblemachines.com";

and problem solved.

''cvs update. I had the same problem. I changed the double quotes to single. Double quotes, in Perl, allow variable interpolation into strings. @nimblemachines.com is considered an array variable.''

----

Next problem: No ''edit text'' function.  Was this intentional?

No, this was the result of mv wiki wiki.cgi.  Yaws will not recognize perl file w/out cgi extension.  Had to change 

 $editscript = "wiki";

to

 $editscript = "wiki.cgi";

And everything here now works.

''I had to work hard to get Apache to work without the .cgi extension. IMHO, Apache's primary design flaw is its reliance on file extensions in order to type files. Without the extension it's lost. I think file extensions are ugly, especially in URIs. So I bent over backwards to make them go away.''

I'll post my notes re: running env.cgi on 1.49 here.  I think making the
upgrade on anarch will fix these issues.  I'll try to get to this first
part of the week.  We'll need to coordinate schedules a bit.

Looks like edittext now works on yaws 1.48.  -- DouglasShacteau

I lied.  It works on the welcome page and nowhere else.  Hmmmm.
