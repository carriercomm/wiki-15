There's a few itchy spots in the diff code.  Annoying, but not catastrophic.

See StatusReg for one and I just found another:

This is from [[http://dev.nimblemachines.com/wiki?diff=WikiUriFormat the diff of WikiUriFormat]]:

  No newline at end of file          ;; No need to display "No newline blah"
 I'll finish this later. I'm tired.

 TangentialInterlude

 TinyURL No newline at end of file 

Obviously this displays on any page where the user didn't bother to hit the
return key at the end of a sentence; I just happened to notice it on the above page(s).

Hm, yes, that's a ''feature'' inherited from the diff command. I recently discovered that it is actually not necessary to run the diff tool for the limited form of diffs we are currently using. It would be sufficient to read the two versions, and mark all those lines in the newer version that are not common to both versions. It should be possible to implement that with Perl hashes. --MichaelPruemm
