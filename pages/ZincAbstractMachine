2005 April 26 09:49. I've started reading the ''The ZINC Experiment''. I am skipping the too abstract theoretical parts on the first reading to get an overview of the paper. It is quite understandable, even though I have never heard of ''Krivine's machine'' before (I do have a vague understanding now). --MichaelPruemm
