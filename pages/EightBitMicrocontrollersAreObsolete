Ok, maybe not ''entirely'' obsolete, but getting there quickly.

To put this remark into perspective, read this article about [[http://www.ganssle.com/articles/8and16bit.htm 8 and 16 Bit Microcontrollers]]. Unfortunately, there's no date on this article. It may have appeared in the [[http://www.embedded.com Embedded Systems journal]], but I didn't check. --MichaelPruemm

Over the last ten or so years, I've "checked in" periodically with the state of 8-bit microcontrollers, hoping to find something more delicious (and better suited to Forth, among other languages) than the 8051 or HC11 or various PIC derivatives. I never found anything I liked.

Sure, there are lots of tiny chips out there that can do amazing things, but you're stuck programming weird and awkward old-school architectures, in assembler (or throwing away what performance you ''do'' have by using a C compiler). Even though ''some'' of these things are cheap, many aren't that cheap. [[http://silabs.com/ Silicon Labs]], n!!eacute!! Cygnal, sell quite fast 8051 derivatives (25M clock, and many instructions execute in one cycle) but prices start at $7 or so, and go up from there. And you're stuck with an 8051, albeit a very fast one.

I have hoped, for years, that my architecture of choice, the ArmArchitecture (hereafter "ARM"), would someday take over the world.

Well, folks, it looks like it is finally poised to do so. Not so long ago Philips [[http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/news/content/file_949.html announced]] an [[http://arm.com/ ARM]] [[http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/ARM7TDMI.html 7TDMI]]-based, low pin-count (48) microcontroller, with on-chip Flash (up to 512k in some variants) and RAM (up to 64k). It runs at 60M, and because of some cleverness w.r.t. the Flash memory interface, it can mostly execute '''full speed''' directly out of Flash. These things are relatively cheap considering what you get. Prices seem to start around the $10 mark. But you get a very capable microcontroller that can double as a medium-speed DSP: it can do a 32x32 multiply-accumulate in 4 clocks (one clock per 8 bits of coefficient).

Philips are [[http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/news/content/file_1107.html
constantly adding]] new variations and new peripherals. The initial member, and the most "basic" in the line, is the [[http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/pip/LPC2106.html LPC2106]]. It has 128k Flash, 64k RAM, lots of peripherals, but no A/D or D/A, and no CAN interface. Another interesting variant is the [[http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/pip/LPC2129.html LPC2129]], which has A/D and CAN interfaces, but less RAM (16k).

Many believe, and I agree, that the ARM architecture is poised to be the 8051 for ''this'' millenium.

I'm very excited about these chips, and would like to build some kickass tools for programming them. I've written an ARM assembler and disassembler in Forth, and have done a lot of thinking about how to structure a native Forth. I'd also like to see some kind of small, strict functional language on one of these. Can we fit a Caml-like runtime in 8k or so?

Cheap development boards are also available. [[http://sparkfun.com/ Sparkfun]] (in Colorado) carry the [[http://olimex.com/dev/ Olimex]] boards (made in Bulgaria!), in addition to wacky robotics stuff. [[http://newmicros.com/ New Micros]] (a Forth vendor!), sell several interesting LPC2106 variants.

I recently discovered the [[http://www.mpeltd.demon.co.uk/usbstamp.htm USB ARM Stamp]] from MPE, also a Forth vendor. --MichaelPruemm

[[http://analog.com/ Analog Devices]] (forgive the lame links: their web site is down right now!) and [[http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?family_id=605 Atmel]] (and maybe others too) have entered the fray with their own variants.

If you're still interested in playing around with obsolete 8-bit micros, there are a few variants that might be amusing. [[http://microchip.com/ Microchip]] make several PICs that fit into 8-pin or 16-pin DIP packages. [[http://www.cypress.com/portal/server.pt?space=CommunityPage&control=SetCommunity&CommunityID=209&PageID=215&gid=13&fid=24&category=All&showall=false Cypress]] got into the mix with their own (??) simple 8-bit architecture, and a novel configurable chip that comes in tiny packages. And several vendors
make small 8051s as well. Philips are still [[http://www.semiconductors.philips.com/catalog/45988/45992/45995/index.html#45995 tweaking and improving their 8051 lineup]], as are an army of other players, including [[http://atmel.com/products/8051/ Atmel]], [[http://www.sst.com/products.xhtml/embedded_controllers/ SST]], [[http://analog.com/ Analog Devices]],
[[http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/4078 Dallas/Maxim]], and zillions of others as well.
