When adding colors for the "voices" I also made it so that an a element (like in a signature) inside the voice div would take the color of the voice div. But I ''don't'' want this to happen with links to non-existent pages.

Can we do exclusion in this way? So that an a.missing is ''always'' a certain color, regardless of its nesting? I'm not enough of a CSS god to figure this out.

NonExistentPages now render in an ugly dark magenta color. Maybe this will be more visible. Color changeable by request. (Or, do it yourself, by editing style/screen.css.)

The margins were bothering me.  I changed l and r to be 5 picas instead of 3 and 1.  I left t and b alone, although I personally would like to see a little more space at the top.  Revert at your whim.
