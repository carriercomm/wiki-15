An example (given in RequestsForFeatures and also mentioned in LinkMarkupNotes) is IsbnFinder.

It is a page that consists of a series of parameterized URIs, which are filled when the page is rendered by taking their variable (parameter) values from the query string of the URI that "invoked" them.

A concrete example might make this easier to understand. Powell's Books's web site, [[http://powells.com/ powells.com]], "understands" ISBN queries of the form:

  [[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=0521644089]]

Similarly, Amazon's site "understands"

  [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0618122141]]

(BTW: Both of these are in the InterMap - with prefixes Powells and Amazon - if you want to play around with them.)

So, in our IsbnFinder template page, we would put

  [[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=${isbn}]]
  [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=${isbn}]]

Actually, with InterMap-enabled links we should be able to write:

  [[Powells:${isbn}]]
  [[Amazon:${isbn}]]

If we then viewed this page from an ISBN wiki link (ie, the link generated by the wiki markup "ISBN 0521644089"), with a URI like this:

  wiki?IsbnFinder&isbn=0521644089

the page links would get instantiated as

  [[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=0521644089]]
  [[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0521644089]]

with the ${isbn} variable replaced by the value of isbn in the query string.

This is a simple technique that probably has lots of cool applications.
