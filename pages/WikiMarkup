In many ways MarkupTest is a better page to look at if you're curious what the markup on this wiki is, or is trying to be (this week - it keeps changing ;-).

Perhaps eventually these two pages can be merged, since the markup tutorial should make a good "regression test" of the markup engine.

'''NOTE!''' Until DavidFrech stops futzing with pre, you have to edit the text of this page to see the markup examples.  Sorry.  Spankies with a wet noodle is clearly in order.
