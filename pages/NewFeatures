This isn't exactly a new feature of the wiki, but nimblemachines.com has grown the ability to host readonly access to (a sanitized version) of its [[http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion]] repository.

Sanitized in the sense that only projects that are "safe" to export publicly are exported - at the moment this is limited to muforth and the target-* projects. The MuForth page has details.

A small change, but potentially painful for those of you with strong muscle memory: I've switched the Tweak and Save buttons on the edit page interface. Tweak is now first (it is the more common). The idea was that you could tab out of the edit box and hit Space to save the page.

I've also removed the comment box, for now. It was just in the way.

New! Obfuscated mailto links, to foil spammers. The email address is encoded in a secret way...

Syntax:

  [[mailto:email@example.com link text]]

renders as [[mailto:email@example.com link text]].

The link text should be something ''other than'' your email address!

>>

I doubt that the encoding you use is able to stop harvesting of email addresses. Only the most naive implementations of an email address scanner will be fooled by this. --MichaelPruemm

We tried it on the anarchitech wiki, and I never receive spam on that address. Go figure!

Now featuring automagic generation of a [[http://flickr.com flickr]] "badge" on any page, by just saying

  [flickr]

where you want the badge to go. Defaults to a horizontal row of five pictures, randomly chosen from ''all'' the user's photos.

It can do a lot more as well; see FlickrMarkup for the details.

Enjoy! --DavidFrech

----

I've also changed the width and margins so the site should be much more readable. It was too wide to read comfortably. --DavidFrech

We now have some support for ordered and unordered lists:

* Write items starting with '''#''' or '''*''' on a single line.

* Separate items in the list with ''double newlines'', just as everything else in  this wiki.

* The first item in the list determines the list kind.

* Nested lists (level 2 and up) are ''not supported''.

Lists end with the next paragraph that is not a list item. --MichaelPruemm

I forgot to mention another small change I made. Links to non-existent pages now go directly to an edit page, rather than to an "empty" page that invites you to add content. The edit page for empty pages has a similar "invitation" to add content.

I'm not sure if this is really a "feature" but I've changed (slightly) the format of URIs that the wiki script generates to refer to its own pages.

It used to be that to show a page (say, RecentChanges) the link generated was

  wiki?RecentChanges

I had to do some slightly clever code to parse this (MichaelPruemm even complained that it was confusing, which it was), and I have a conjecture that the URI format is causing the web spiders (like Yahoo and Google) not to index the site deeper than the front page and the pages it points to. They index RecentChanges but not the pages it points to, so they miss the entire wiki.

Wiki links are now in the form

  wiki?show=RecentChanges

or, more generally,

  wiki?action=page

This checkin may do nothing to improve the spidering behavior. In that case, I'll try some other formats. Earlier tonight I was working on using this format:

  wiki/pagename/action

but ran into trouble with search queries, among other things. (And I had to write some wacky code to make the relative links work, since now the browser thinks we are deeper into the URI-space/filesystem, and so a number of "../" prefixes are required.) The trouble with queries is that the browser wants to create a URI like this when it submits a GET form:

  wiki?search=pagename

rather than

  wiki/pagename/search

I may still be able to use "wiki/pagename" for normal ("show") links, and perhaps for edit links too, and use query strings for other purposes, such as search. That may be my next move if the search engines don't behave.

Again, though, the changes that I checked in tonight, because of some code refactoring, will make that (future) change easier.

Hm, that's interesting. When I put some of my photos on the web, I used URLs like

  http://www.pruemm.org/album.php?a=bangalore

to access an "album" of photos, and

  http://www.pruemm.org/album.php?a=bangalore&p=bus

to get to an individual photo in an album.

I found that the spiders indexed not only the start page listing all the albums, but also the dynamic pages, down to the individual photo pages.
-- MichaelPruemm

Yes, I reallly don't understand this. [[http://anarchitech.org/wiki Doug's yaws wiki]] gets completely indexed as well; it has URIs of the form

  http://anarchitech.org/wiki/showPage.yaws?node=home

What's interesting to me is that both Michael's example and this yaws example have query strings of the form

  script?x=y

rather than

  script?x

which is how this wiki used to "represent" wiki links. Since it is now in line with the "?x=y" form, it will be interesting to see what happens with the spiders. --DavidFrech

The diff links are back. Look at the footer of each page. The page displayed by default shows changes in the last 24h. ''If you would prefer that this be a different (larger) number, tell me and I'll change the generated links. ;-)'' --DavidFrech

== 2005 February 11 20:38

Phew. Fix to wiki (see below) is complete.

== 2005 February 11 19:07

'''Important note to wiki developers:''' I just realized that some changes I wanted to stay local to the running version - specifically the "mirroring" between the writable and readonly versions - got checked into the repo.

I'm going to try to ''carefully'' check in a version that doesn't have those changes, and then to update the running version so that it keeps them. Please do '''not''' check in "wiki" or "config.pl" from tesla. Both files have local customization that needs to stay local!

Thank you!

Diffs between the current version of a page and some earlier version can be generated by using an URL of the form

  wiki?diff=PageName&when=2005-02-09T12:34:56   -- full ISO time
  wiki?diff=PageName&when=2005-02-09T12:34      -- without seconds
  wiki?diff=PageName&when=2005-02-02            -- no time means T00:00
  wiki?diff=PageName&when=36h                   -- 36 hours ago

If the ''when'' parameter is missing, ''when=24h'' is used.

Example: [[wiki?diff=NewFeatures]]

>>
 
....or [[wiki?diff=NewFeatures Page History]].  Could make it a habit to put this at the top of each page.  If we like this we could recursively add
a ''Page History'' to the top of the current pages.  Argument for: it looks
''cleaner''. Nice feature. :-)

>>>

I think Michael was giving the example of how to form the links, since for now you have to form them ''yourself'' in the address bar. His example says, essentially, "show me all the changes to this page (NewFeatures) in the last 24h". It's an odd example, because "new features" ''sounds'' like "changes to this page". Sort of. Or am I totally misunderstanding?

>

>>

Yes, I understand that Michael was demonstrating the method; the point of 
my terse aside was that when we use it in a page that it might be graphically more pleasing to ''hide the mechanism with syntactic sugar.''
Period.  Like we do with URI's, n'est-ce pas?

As for your comment re: NewFeatures, ummm, I found his description perfectly clear: the mechanism is wiki?diff=PageName and the page he
points to in his example is this page.  It sounds like you're concerned
that the unwary will think that NewFeatures is somehow part of the diff
mechanism.  Or am I totally misunderstanding you???

I originally wanted to have the ''last edited <date>'' at the bottom of each page be just such a link to some form of the page's history. It's not clear yet exactly what form that should take. I could, in the interim, re-enable those links; they would show changes in the last 24h. --DavidFrech

Changed or added "paragraphs" (HTML block elements) are highlighted with a different background color. Deletions are not shown.

Minor tweak of voices. Now hrules ('----') and headings ('=', '==', etc) reset to voice 1.

----

== 2005 February 04 13:12

Added the capability to mark up "voices". See VoicesTestPage. The markup will improve slightly (fewer blank lines) when I fix the double newline thing.

I like this functionality, but I wonder if there shouldn't be certain "resetting" markup. Maybe hrules will always return to voice 1. I was thinking headings too, but then Randy's thought about them would have been attributed to me. ;-)

''Hey!  Link "Randy's thought" to the referenced page!''

== 2005 February 04 01:51

Not exactly a new feature, but a change. Doug expressed concern over the trail of IPs in the public version of the wiki. I went to great lengths to keep the mirroring but to strip the IPs out of RecentChanges.

----

This page hasn't been updated in six days. Is anyone working on this thing?!?

Actually, it's been nice to take a break and just ''use'' the darn thing. Even in its broken state it's pretty cool & rather useful. --DavidFrech

== 2005 January 28 13:44

Noting that other wiki engines were doing this, I've added robots meta tags to pages. Normal wiki pages get "index,follow"; edit and search result pages get "noindex,nofollow".

----

== 2005 January 28 13:17

I changed the way "minor edits" work. I was frustrated by having to click twice when making minor edits, which I seem to be making a lot of ;-).

So, I changed the interface. Now, if you make major changes, click Save, and RecentChanges will get updated. For minor changes, click Tweak, and RecentChanges is left alone. There is a nice note in the edit page explaining this.

----

== 2005 January 27 19:27

I forgot to mention another addition. There is now a "minor edit" checkbox on the edit page. (It defaults to unchecked; perhaps this is wrong. Do we make big changes more than small ones? Or the other way?)

''Hmmm.  My vote is default to unchecked.  If you care about the content of a page you'll be interested in any edits, save those of spelling/punctuation CoreErection.  Perhaps a suggestion to click the box in that case.'' --DouglasShacteau

If unchecked, RecentChanges will be updated to show that the page was edited. If checked, RecentChanges will be left alone. So for minor punctuation, spelling, or other formatting cleanups, checking minor edit helps to prevent RecentChanges from getting spammed. OTOH, if you've added content, however small, please do ''not'' check the minor edit box; people will want to know about your new content.

----

== 2005 January 27 19:19

I made a (small) structural change to make life easier for administrators. If you're not an admin, you can skip this.

The variables that set the look and feel of the wiki get default values, but now an additional file, config.pl, is read in that can contain site-local overrides, to change the wiki title, icon/logo, etc. It is very easy, and makes staying current with the wiki code easy, because changes to it do not clobber your local changes.

''Yesssssssss.'' --DouglasShacteau

== 2005 January 25 00:56

I added Powells and Amazon to the InterMap. Check this out:

[[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0471010901]]

Amazon:0471010901
Powells:0471010901

[[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0618122141]]

Amazon:0618122141
Powells:0618122141

[[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=0521644089]]

Amazon:0521644089
Powells:0521644089

I was thinking of doing an InterMap-like ISBN link; perhaps it would generate both the Amazon link (for reading reviews) and the Powells link (for buying the book).

== 2005 January 24 23:11

I just added a wacky feature that might be nice for change logs. If you type [""now] it will be converted, as the file is written out, to the current date & time, thereby making a timestamp.

''NOTE: Until I make this smarter (ie, ignoring preformatted text), it will likely wreak havoc on code posted/pasted into pages. It's pretty likely that someone somewhere will have a list or array (depends on your language(s) of choice ;-) that looks like [""now], and it will get clobbered. Double brackets would help a little, but would still clobber lists of lists...''

I also added an edit collision feature. If, when you try to save your changes, someone else has edited and saved the same file you are editing (ie, if the file modification time is different than it was when you ''started'' editing), you are notified, and given a hint as to how to resolve the issue.

I tried doing a three-way diff, but I couldn't get output that was helpful.
