Ok, so this is a bugs page.

Some markup is broken.  

'''bold'''  that worked.

'''bold!'''  that worked.

'''BOLD!'''  that didn't. BO""LD!

'''BOLD'''   that didn't.  BO""LD

Guess what italics does? ;-)

''ITALICA'' ITAL""ICA

''These all work fine. The bold is bold and the italic is italic. Since they look like acronyms they're being turned into WikiLink""s. I showed above, by interrupting the link formation, that your BO""LD is truly '''BO""LD'''!''

''Of course, my links seem to have other problems. ;-) It looks like you have to put double double-quotes between every letter of an acronym in order to interfere with link generation. This is another misfeature of auto-linking that could be fixed by adopting WikiPedia's linking style (see WikiPedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links_and_URLs).''

Que?  It's not a bug, it's a featuritis?  Sorry, but you should
allow allcaps bold w/out it trying to create a wikiword. IMNSHO.

''I didn't say it wasn't a bug, just that it was working as intended. Bugs can be both failures in mapping intentions to implementations, and failures in mapping rationality to intentions. ;-)''

Can't display links in column:

''Fixed.''

''OUCH!'' Don't click on the date link!  ''Internal Server Error''

''As yet unimplemented. Depends on doing some kind of backwards diff.''

This has been implemented in the meantime. Shall we remove this text?

This is interesting:

[[http://anarchitech.org Anarchitech]] . [[http://nimblemachines.com Nimble Machines]]

Apparently we can't display hrefs in one row?  Or is formatting requirement counterintuitive?

Ah so.  Hmmm.  Does this seem counterintuitive to anyone else?  Admittedly
it looks nicer in the edit window...... -- DouglasShacteau

''I think it might have to do with greedy regular expressions. I may have left out the trailing ? on a few key REs. --DavidFrech''

''Yes. This was the reason. Fixed!''

Groovin' baby.

This is bothering me, so it's definitely in the ''pest'' category, although
it isn't really a bug.  ''Voices'' rocks, but I want two things: I want
links to display in blue/red(followed) and I want our signatures to do the
same.  I'm looking for feedback on this issue Before I Do Something Dangerous Like Play With Perl And Cut Myself. I will be happy to suffer silently with this irritating design flaw if it isn't bothering anyone else.

>>

I ''think'' you can fix this with only a CSS change. If that's not true, then the link generation code might be required to change, so that links can be annotated ("classed") more flexibly. Whack on the CSS first, and see what you get. --DavidFrech

[[http://anarchitech.org/ Test link.]] Did this work or not?  Ok, it did, but we were both working on things and now I'm not entirely sure who did what.  Let me know, it's late and it's feeding time at the zoo.

(Note to David: Glad we sorted ''that'' out. ''';-)''' )

Nested emphasis is broken:

  '''''five quotes should produce a proper nesting of <em> and <strong>'''''

but '''''five quotes produce an improper nesting of <em> and <strong>'''''. Use ''View Source'' in your browser to see what I mean, or [[http://validator.w3.org/check/referer validate the XHTML of this page]].

2005 February 24 12:49: Fixed.

>>>

Sorry to be picky: I don't see that change reflected in CVS.

>>

  cvs log wiki

shows revision 1.57 with this change.

>>>

And if I look at the running wiki code, I get the feeling, that you only solved the special case above. Let's give this a try:

  '''''five quotes and '' two''''' and another '' two produces what?

Answer: '''''five quotes and '' two''''' and another '' two produces what?

It is still invalid XHTML. IMO, we haven't defined what input like this should produce. The current version using regexes won't be able to handle this. One possibility would be to disallow single quotes in  ''<em>'' and '''<strong>'''. But it would be nice to say something like ''it's not broken'' with a single apostroph in it.

>>

Regular expressions can't handle nesting. I tried to change greedy versus non-greedy, change the order (first three then two, or vice versa), and nothing worked. Only a recursive parsing implementation will do this properly, unless the two kinds of markup are made distinct. Right now there is ambiguity about how to match, because both use the same characters.

I think we should simply change to something like **bold** and __italic__. --DavidFrech

>>>

Ohforpetessake.  

 **bold**
 ''italic''
 __underline__

Picky mode on: your proposed markup for italic is counterintuitive at best.

/:p

--NeddySeagoon

>>

I don't think

  ''italic''

is particularly intuitive; it just happens to be popular among wiki authors. I chose __italic__ because that's how, in the past, authors marked up their typescripts to show that something should be typeset in italic, and there is little reason to have underline markup (esp on the Web where it will confuse people into thinking that it is a link).

If you absolutely must have them all, how about

  **bold**
  //italic//
  __underline__
  --strikethrough--
  ||monospace||
  @@monospace@@
  ^^monospace^^

Clearly I can't make up my mind about monospace. Also, I'm clearly ''not'' creating structural markup - this is presentational rather than structural. Any ideas? --DavidFrech

>>>

Yes, this is much better.  And go with the double pipes for monospace.

'''2005 March 09 09:55'''. I tried to enter the Greek letters mu and xi using HTML named entities

  ?  and  ?

This works fine and displays fine. However, when I then edit the page again, I see the real Greek letters in the edit box and when I save the page again, the Greek characters are gone and instead I see somthing like

  ?  and  ?

with hex digits.

It probably has something to do with the browser sending Unicode or Unicode characters as encoded entities. It would be nice if the Wiki could handle that. --MichaelPruemm

>>

Yes, I think our browsers are "helpfully" converting the string representing entities to the character entities themselves before saving. I probably need to modify the form POST code to re-encode these. Or something. I was surprised by this behavior: I don't think it makes any sense.

This is now '''fixed'''. There is no way to keep the browser from meddling, so I decided we needed to quote the entities ourselves. I've added the following simple markup:

  !!entity!! or ??entity??

Choose one and tell me which you like. Using this technique,

  !!lambda!! !!mu!! !!xi!! !!eacute!! !!uuml!!

render as !!lambda!! !!mu!! !!xi!! !!eacute!! !!uuml!!. --DavidFrech

>

OK, that'll work. It is probably not a good idea to use actual HTML markup, because that's what Wiki markup is for.

Wouldn't it make more sense to use markup with brackets? The wiki already expands a few things within brackets, so why not the entities? Just a thought... 

>>>

 [!lambda!] [!mu!]

Agreed, something like this might make more logical sense, but it stinks (kinesthetically) if you're in qwerty mode.....  Much easier to type

 !!blah!!

Kinesthetic transparency == Happy Users

Of course, one could make the arg that a little pain never hurt anyone.....

'''2005 April 07 21:30''' From the source, I see that inter-wiki links ''require at least one space'' before the closing ]]. The link [[Wiki:WikiHistory]] does not work, while this one, [[Wiki:WikiHistory ]], does. The latter shows the enclosing brackets, though.

Hm, I see, this is a user error, so this is not a bug. I can simply write the links without [[ and ]]. Stupid me. --MichaelPruemm
