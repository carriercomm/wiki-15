== What is intermap and why should I care?

intermap is a feature of certain wikis (I discovered it in UseMod:UseModWiki) that facilitates making cross-wiki links. Actually it works for more than just wikis: anything with a URI query interface is intermappable.

The UseMod link above is an example. The href that is generated is rather complicated, so using intermap saves a lot of typing.

Basically, it is a bunch of macros. When you type a link of the form prefix:link, the wiki engine looks up ''prefix'' in its intermap. If it finds it, it replaces it with the destination site's initial URI, and adds, as a suffix, the ''link'' that you specified.

Here are some examples.

Wiki:WikiWikiWeb ....
Google:dragonflybsd ....
Wikipedia:Public_key_cryptography

When the wiki engine starts up (ie, whenever you read a wiki page ;-), it reads the intermap file that contains all the macros.
InterMapTxt is a current copy of the intermap file, but it is ''not'' the real thing. Changes made there will ''not'' affect the operation of this wiki.
