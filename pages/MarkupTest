See also MarkupDiscussion. Or maybe MarkupNotes. Make sure to play in the SandBox.

The markup is shown in two ways: first as typed in, then as rendered.

----

= Headings and rules

 = heading 1

= heading 1

 == heading 2

== heading 2

 === heading 3

=== heading 3

 ==== heading 4

==== heading 4

 ----

creates an hrule:

----

= Lists

 * a list
 * of things

* a list
* of things

 # an ordered list
 # of things

# an ordered list
# of things

 * an unordered list
 ** with depth
 *** and more depth

* an unordered list
** with depth
*** and more depth

 # an ordered list
 ## with depth
 ### and more depth

# an ordered list
## with depth
### and more depth

 * a list
 *# with mixed up
 *#* items that
 *#*# keeps on going

* a list
*# with mixed up
*#* items that
*#*# keeps on going

= Inline markup

 ''italic text'' '''bold''' '''''both'''''

''italic text'' '''bold''' '''''both'''''

 ''A sentence
 that crosses
 multiple lines
 in the markup
 but should 
 '''all''' be italic
 except for one bold
 word.''

''A sentence
that crosses
multiple lines
in the markup
but should 
'''all''' be italic
except for one bold
word.''

----

= Making links

 [[http://freebsd.org]]

creates an unnamed URI link: [[http://freebsd.org]]

 [[http://freebsd.org Some kind of operating system.]]

creates a named URI link: [[http://freebsd.org Some kind of operating system.]]

 CamelCase words

create CamelCase links.

 Camel""Case

interrupted by double double-quotes prevents making a Camel""Case link. (Note: this is '''very''' likely to change or go away, so do not depend on it or use it much until things stabilize.)

 Wiki:PairProgramming

creates an interwiki link: Wiki:PairProgramming.

 WikiPedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links_and_URLs.

is another, fancier interwiki link: WikiPedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links_and_URLs.

You should be able to combine these.

 [[Wiki:WikiWikiWeb Ward's wiki]] .
 [[?MarkupTest some markup]] .
 [[?MarkupTest CamelCase]]

render as [[Wiki:WikiWikiWeb Ward's wiki]] .
[[?MarkupTest some markup]] .
[[?MarkupTest CamelCase]]

----

= Preformatted (verbatim) text

 This should be <pre>, without any CamelCase links, ''italic'' text,
 or any of that '''nonsense'''.

  [now] now remains unchanged in preformatted text!

----

= For advanced users

 [now]

creates a time stamp ("2005 January 27 18:53") at edit save time. '''Note:''' this is prevented from happening in preformatted text, so it won't interfere with program code.

 [namesearch]

creates a search box:

[namesearch]

to search for strings matching page names. Try it! Type something and press return.

 [textsearch]

creates a search box:

[textsearch]

to search for strings in the text of the pages. Try it! Type something and press return.

----

= Quotes and definition lists (NYI)

"" This should
be a big block quote. But the code hasn't been added
yet, or doesn't
work.

''Hmm, another case of No Yeti Intrusion.''
