Sometime in 1996 or 1997 I was thinking about getting (building?) a nifty new bicycle, and from a magazine jotted down a couple of telephone numbers. One was for Torelli; the other was for [[http://rivbike.com/ Rivendell]]. I never called either one.

Several months ago the idea crossed my mind to see what Rivendell were lately up to. I ended up spending probably an entire day reading everything on their web site! [[http://rivbike.com/html/about.html Their mission]] agrees with mine: they build and sell bicycles that are intended to last forever, to be beautiful, to be comfortable, and to be useful. They are not built to be the lightest thing on the block; they care more about comfort and safety than weight. Their bicycles are steel, with steel forks - because steel is strong, cheap, durable, gives lots of warning before failing (unlike carbon fiber forks!!), and is actually quite light.

They build bikes with room for big tires and fenders, and with braze-ons for racks. These are bikes that will carry you and your stuff in comfort across continents.

I could ramble on here for a long time. Instead I'm going to suggest that you, dear Reader, visit [[http://rivbike.com/ Rivendell]] on the web or in person and see what they are about. Even if you don't buy a bicycle from them - they are somewhat expensive! - you can enjoy their attitude and opinions.

Here are some pictures of one of their cool bikes - the Atlantis - a go-anywhere, do-anything bike (and note the cool moustache handlebars):
