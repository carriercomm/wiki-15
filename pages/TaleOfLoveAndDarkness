AmosOz on "Cover to Cover" on KPFA.

Sounds like an interesting author, and an interesting book. About the background of his Jewish parents in Europe in the 30s. He has a circumspect and healthy view of the Israel-Palestine conflict.

He said a lot more than that; I'm just putting this here to remind myself that the book exists and sounds quite interesting.
