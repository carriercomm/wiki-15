Author of PracticalInternetGroupware, which is now sadly out of print. A smart guy, with lots of ideas about groupware, peer-to-peer, distributed HTTP servers, web services. Lots of things.

Many of the ideas in PracticalInternetGroupware blew my mind. Unlike most O'Reilly books, which are "Howtos", mostly, PIG has mind-blowing ideas on every page.

Jon has an [[http://udell.roninhouse.com/ old blog]] and a [[http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/ newer one]]; access to his older content at Byte is now by paid subscription only. Losers.

I tried to find his comments about [[http://twistedmatrix.com/ Twisted]], but I couldn't.
