A while back I saw some really neat [[http://breezerbikes.com/ Breezer]] city bicycles at the Missing Link, a cool bike coop in Berkeley, California.

The bikes I liked were the [[http://www.breezerbikes.com/bike_details.cfm?bikeType=town&frame=d&bike=uptown Uptown]]
and the [[http://www.breezerbikes.com/bike_details.cfm?bikeType=town&frame=d&bike=villager Villager]]. Some pics:

They are very similar. The Uptown has 8 speeds instead of 7, a slightly nicer way of generating power for the lights (built into the front hub instead of rubbing on the back tire), and a front suspension fork.

Both bikes have:

* fenders

* chain guard

* rear rack

* lights

* heavy-duty wide tires on 26" rims

Another possibility (though I haven't seen one in person) is the [[http://specialized.com/ Specialized]] [[http://specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?sid=05Globe Globe]]. It looks like this:

Differences from Breezers:

* more gears (24 instead of 8/7) using derailleurs rather than geared hub; more flexible gearing, easier to fix, but harder to keep clean

* 700C wheels instead of 26"

I wonder how expensive those bicycles are in comparison to similar bicycles in Germany. I am currently looking for a new bicycle (instead of always using my wife's :-). --MichaelPruemm
