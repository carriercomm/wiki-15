I'd like to put here all the questions and sources regarding markup issues. There is also a LinkMarkupNotes page.

----

The [[http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/ HTML 4 spec]] defines the following block elements:

 BLOCKQUOTE

 DL   definition list
   DT  definition term
   DD  definition description

It also define the following inline elements:

 EM       ''text''
 STRONG  '''text'''
 DFN
 CODE
 SAMP
 KBD
 VAR
 CITE
 ABBR
 ACRONYM
 Q

Do we want to include any of these in our wiki markup? And if so, what should their wiki markup look like? (Remember: structural, not presentational.)

''At the risk of playing devil's advocate, I have a concern that we're heading toward CreepingFeaturitis here.  Are we thinking of doing this just because we can, or because it maps to the original idea of a dead simple interface and markup language?  Let's leave it out, and let the need develop rather than anticipating any needs beyond the most basic.  --DouglasShacteau''

I absolutely agree that we shouldn't add something (more markup) just because we can. But I ''am'' interested in all of the block markup and at least one of the above inline elements: '''samp'''. I'd like to be able to markup inline the same way we do with ''pre''.

Once the details are hammered out about how the formatting engine works (like once I revamp the double-newline separation), adding new markup ''to the engine'' is basically trivial. And people don't have to use it. They don't even need to know it's there - you can get by (as we are now!) with a very small set of markup.
