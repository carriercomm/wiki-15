The markup is shown in two ways: first as typed in, then as rendered.

----

= Headings and rules

 = heading 1

= heading 1

 == heading 2

== heading 2

 === heading 3

=== heading 3

 ==== heading 4

==== heading 4

 ----

creates a horizontal rule:

----

= Lists

Currently nested lists are not allowed. And for (silly) implementation reasons blank lines are required between list items.

 * a list

 * of things

* a list

* of things

 # an ordered list

 # of things

# an ordered list

# of things

----

= Inline markup

 ''italic text'' '''bold''' '''''both'''''

''italic text'' '''bold''' '''''both'''''

 ''A sentence
 that crosses
 multiple lines
 in the markup
 but should 
 '''all''' be italic
 except for one bold and italic
 word.''

''A sentence
that crosses
multiple lines
in the markup
but should 
'''all''' be italic
except for one bold and italic
word.''

----

= Making links

 [[http://freebsd.org]]

creates an unnamed URI link: [[http://freebsd.org]]

 [[http://freebsd.org Some kind of operating system.]]

creates a named URI link: [[http://freebsd.org Some kind of operating system.]]

 CamelCase words

create CamelCase links.

 Wiki:PairProgramming

creates an interwiki link: Wiki:PairProgramming.

 Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page

is another interwiki link: Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page.

 [[Wiki:PairProgramming pair programming]]

creates an interwiki link with "custom" link text: [[Wiki:PairProgramming pair programming]]

It's also possible to leave the "custom" field blank, thus:

 [[Wiki:PairProgramming]]

This renders like the version without brackets: [[Wiki:PairProgramming]]

----

= Preformatted (verbatim) text

 This should be <pre>, without any CamelCase links, ''italic'' text,
 or any of that '''nonsense'''.

  [now] now remains unchanged in preformatted text!

----

= For advanced users

 [now]

creates a time stamp ("2005 January 27 18:53") at edit save time. '''Note:''' this is prevented from happening in preformatted text, so it won't interfere with program code.

 [namesearch]

creates a search box:

[namesearch]

to search for strings matching page names. Try it! Type something and press return.

 [textsearch]

creates a search box:

[textsearch]

to search for strings in the text of the pages. Try it! Type something and press return.
