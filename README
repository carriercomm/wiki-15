If you want to use this wiki with web-writable pages, then you need to (as
root!)

  chown -R www pages

assuming www is the user that the server runs as.

If you want a readonly "wiki", you'll want to do two things:

  * have the pages/ tree owned by any user other than www;
  * change $editscript (in config.pl) to "never"

The only URIs that fire up the CGI script are / (invokes the
DirectoryIndex, which invokes "wiki") and /wiki. Since "never" matches
neither, no pages will be editable.

It's also possible to do this (in .htaccess):

---------------------------------------------------------
DirectoryIndex browse
Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks

<Files wiki>
  SetHandler cgi-script
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "My private wiki"
  AuthUserFile /some/path/to/passwd/file

# this is optional:
  Require user foobar
</Files>

<Files browse>
  SetHandler cgi-script
</Files>
---------------------------------------------------------

Assuming $editscript is set to "wiki", this will allow only authenticated
users to write the wiki (via wiki?page); for most users it will be
readonly (thru the "browse" script), and now DirectoryIndex points to
browse. browse is, of course, symlinked to the wiki script.
